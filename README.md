## Predictive Analytics Learning Exercises

### Description
This repository contains challenges and exercises related to Predictive Analytics created for learning purposes.

### Repository Structure
The repository consists of two notebooks and two datasets:

1. Regression Models Applied to Time Series (scikit-learn)
In this notebook, a predictive model is developed using a retail dataframe to forecast sales quantities for a specific item. The model is built by experimenting with various regression models and incorporating synthetic variables such as lags, differences, months, and weekdays. The final model achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 14.298%.
- Dataset used: Dataframe_Retail.csv

2. Time Series Clustering - KMeans Model
In this exercise, a KMeans model is employed to cluster a retail dataset consisting of multiple time series, each representing a different product type.
- Dataset used: df_pivoted.csv
